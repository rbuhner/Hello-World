Hello World!

I've been going at coding nearly solo for the past ten years, and attempting to code in between jobs and life's other hurdles has made for very slow progress.

So I am reaching out, and hoping to create something better with a community, instead of being huddled in a darkened room frustrated by the couple of lines I can write a week.

I write primarily in java, though trying to re-learn C(++) to leverage some of it's speed.
I am mainly focused in Machine-Learning, specifically in AI Development, though I have only been able to write something on a macro level as of yet.

Hopefully this can be a record of a long and great journey to triumph in bringing more life into this cyber-world, instead of a dusty and half-forgotten legacy of the demented.

Here's to Hope for the Future!

It's been two years and some since I have started saving my progress with Github, and not going to lie it's been looking a bit dusty here as I continue to work for a living instead of a life, and coding when I can.

But good news, I have joined/helped make a new startup named Malum Games Studio (https://www.malumgamesstudio.com/) and slowly we're working out the kinks and getting content out there, like the new Lucky Penny entry we submitted for the #ue4jam on itch.io (https://malumgamesstudio.itch.io/lucky-penny).

I am also still continuing my research into AI (currently the rabbit-hole that is Neural Networks) while I continue my degree in Computer Science and Engineering, and with that see if I can upgrade my side-projects to think for themselves a bit more.

Let's hope the next two years isn't as bad as the first two :D
