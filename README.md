Hello World!

I've been going at coding nearly solo for the past ten years, and attempting to code in between jobs and life's other hurdles has made for very slow progress.

So I am reaching out, and hoping to create something better with a community, instead of being huddled in a darkened room frustrated by the couple of lines I can write a week.

I write primarily in java, though trying to re-learn C(++) to leverage some of it's speed.
I am mainly focused in Machine-Learning, specifically in AI Development, though I have only been able to write something on a macro level as of yet.

Hopefully this can be a record of a long and great journey to triumph in bringing more life into this cyber-world, instead of a dusty and half-forgotten legacy of the demented.

Here's to Hope for the Future!
